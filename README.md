# Smart-parking-system
Smart Parking Using IBM Watson is a parking system that detects the available parking slots and assists the drivers in finding the nearest parking slot. It is a Real-Time application of Internet of Things which has sensors(ultrasonic sensors) equipped in the parking slots that detect the availability of vacant parking slots. This sensor values are sent to IBM Watson service and are stored in a database. A user interface is created using Node Red through which we can inform the users about the availability of vacant. So forth, reducing the time and energy consumed, in finding a parking slot, hence reduce pollution and optimize the utilization of available space.
This project is meant to assist people in finding nearby parking slots in busy and congested places, with ease. It mainly focus on reducing the time in  a finding the parking slots, optimise utilization of available space and avoids the unnecessary travelling through filled parking slots in a parking area. It also helps reduce pollution caused due to the unnecessary travel in finding a parking slot.
